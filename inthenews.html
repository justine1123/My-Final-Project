Saguisag, in an appearance on "Power and Play" with former PBA Commissioner Noli Eala, said that holding events in 2020 is virtually impossible, but the league is studying its options for 2021.<p>

<p>The UAAP was forced to cancel its second semester sports in April due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The new season was supposed to start in September but the global health crisis that spawned quarantine protocols in the country prevented the league from following its traditional schedule.</p></td>
